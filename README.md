# SQL-Basics-Practice

For this assignment the challenges I faced were easy to overcome but included trying to successfully download sqlite and use it in the command line.
After attempting multipe times, I finally opted to use the SQLiteStudio. I had to click around a bit to figure out how to use it but after a while I was able to figure it out.
The assignment reiterated to me to use your resources as I had to keep going back to see the commands that I needed to use.
Overall, this was an good assignment to be introduced t SQL and practice SQL basics.

# SQL-Query-Practice-and-Database-Modification
For this assignment it was more smoother than the previous one because I was able to navigate through SQLiteStudios easier since I used it with the previous assignment. One challenge I faced is remembering to run the command after each one to see the results. Also, a challenge was the syntax structure.
